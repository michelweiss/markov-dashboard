# Markov Probability Dashboard

Exploratory probability dashboard combining state-based models across
financial markets, macro economics, and sports.

Focuses on regime probabilities derived from historical state transitions
(Markov-style models). Designed for research and situational awareness,
not trading automation.

## 🚀 Demo version (out-of-the-box)
